# soreco-firmware
Firmware for soreco Sonos Remote Control.
![Hardware Preview](doc/soreco_hardware_preview.jpeg)

soreco is an open source hardware platform to build a remote controller for Sonos wireless home sound system.
The system is currently under development.

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/65e64e47425b49ffbc05d3c85264677e)](https://www.codacy.com/app/mguntli/soreco-firmware?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=soreco-project/soreco-firmware&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## Usage
Open soreco-firmware.ino in Arduino and flash the NodeMCU 1.0 (or any other ESP-12E Module). 

Interact with the device through the debug console with 115'200bps.

Note: Requires ESP8266 at least board package version 2.4.0-rc2.

### Initializing Submodules
The project uses soreco-protocol to communicate with the smartphone app (soreco-android).
To enable soreco-protocol locally you need to initialize repository submodules.
Run the following command in the checkout directory to do so.
 
```bash
git submodule update --init --remote
```

### Console Commands
The debug console is currently the only way to interact with the device. There are the following commands available to interact with the device:
* help (list all available commands)
* Config.Save (save configuration to persistent storage)
* Config.ClearAll (clear the persistent storage and initialize all values with 0)
* Config.FactoryDefaults (reset all configuration (except DeviceParameters) to factory defaults)
* Config.SerialNumber (get / set the serial number)
* Config.DeviceName (get / set the device name)
* Config.Sonos.Zone (get / set the sonos zone)
* Config.WiFi.SSID (get / set the WiFi SSID to connect to)
* Config.WiFi.Passphrase (get / set the WiFi passphrase for SSID)
* WiFi.Scan (scan and report all available WiFi networks)
* WiFi.Connect (connect to the configured WiFi network)
* WiFi.StartHotspot (start a WiFi hotspot "soreco-xyz", where xyz is the device serial number)
* WiFi.Status (print the WiFi status)
* Sonos.Discover (scan and report all available Sonos devices)
* Sonos.Connect (set Sonos device to control from debug console)
* Sonos.PlayState (get / set the play state ('play' | 'pause') of the Sonos device)
* Sonos.Volume (get / set the volume of the Sonos device)
* Power.Mode (set the power mode ('modem' | 'light' | 'off') of ESP8266)
